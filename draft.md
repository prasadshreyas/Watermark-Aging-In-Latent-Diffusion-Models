Watermark Aging of Images in Latent Diffusion Models

# Abstract

The internet age has enabled easy replication and distribution of multimedia content, making it challenging to verify the originality of any piece. Watermarking techniques, like the Stable Signature, aim to embed invisible markers in content to track and verify its origin. However, as images undergo transformations, filters, or edits, the watermark may
degrade. The concept of "Watermark Aging" delves into this phenomenon of watermark decay over time and modifications.

# Introduction


In the digital era, the rise of diffusion models (DMs) represents a groundbreaking advancement in generative tasks, particularly in image synthesis. These models, surpassing other generative models like GANs and VAEs, offer unmatched quality and diversity in their outputs. This is particularly evident in numerous large-scale DMs, such as the well-known Stable Diffusion, which are increasingly utilized in various practical applications. These applications, driven by an interest in controllable generation like text-to-image tasks, showcase the remarkable capabilities of DMs in a wide range of settings.

However, the widespread adoption of DMs brings forth significant challenges, especially in the realm of multimedia content distribution and replication. This is especially pertinent in the context of images on the internet, which often undergo edits, filters, or transformations. To tackle the challenge of verifying the authenticity and originality of these pieces, watermarking techniques, including methods like Stable Signature, have been developed. These techniques aim to embed invisible markers within the content, helping to track its origin and verify authenticity. Nonetheless, as images undergo various transformations, a phenomenon known as "Watermark Aging" emerges, where the effectiveness of these watermarks may degrade over time and through these modifications.

The legal challenges accompanying DMs are manifold. One key concern is copyright protection, particularly crucial as most applications using DMs offer only black-box APIs, limiting direct access to verify copyrights and licenses. Another challenge is the accurate detection of content generated by DMs. As these models become increasingly capable of producing highly realistic fake content, artworks, or even abusive material, potential legal risks and disputes arise. However, the effectiveness of watermarks in the context of DMs, which typically use longer, stochastic paths for sample generation and feature newly-designed multimodal structures, remains underexplored.

In this rapidly evolving digital landscape, it is vital to understand how watermarks endure and adapt, particularly given the dynamic nature of content life cycles on the internet and social media platforms. Images are often subject to numerous edits, modifications, and repurposing. The paper focuses on the robustness of watermarking techniques, especially in the face of transformations such as cropping, rotation, coloring, and combinations thereof, while paying particular attention to how these watermarks withstand specific types of successive transformations. Addressing these challenges is crucial for harnessing the full potential of DMs while mitigating the associated legal and ethical risks.
