# Abstract

The internet age has enabled easy replication and distribution of multimedia content, making it challenging to verify the originality of any piece. Watermarking techniques, like the Stable Signature, aim to embed invisible markers in content to track and verify its origin. However, as images undergo transformations, filters, or edits, the watermark may
degrade. The concept of "Watermark Aging" delves into this phenomenon of watermark decay over time and modifications.

# Introduction


In the digital era, the rise of diffusion models (DMs) represents a groundbreaking advancement in generative tasks, particularly in image synthesis. These models, surpassing other generative models like GANs and VAEs, offer unmatched quality and diversity in their outputs. This is particularly evident in numerous large-scale DMs, such as the well-known Stable Diffusion, which are increasingly utilized in various practical applications. These applications, driven by an interest in controllable generation like text-to-image tasks, showcase the remarkable capabilities of DMs in a wide range of settings.

However, the widespread adoption of DMs brings forth significant challenges, especially in the realm of multimedia content distribution and replication. This is especially pertinent in the context of images on the internet, which often undergo edits, filters, or transformations. To tackle the challenge of verifying the authenticity and originality of these pieces, watermarking techniques, including methods like Stable Signature, have been developed. These techniques aim to embed invisible markers within the content, helping to track its origin and verify authenticity. Nonetheless, as images undergo various transformations, a phenomenon known as "Watermark Aging" emerges, where the effectiveness of these watermarks may degrade over time and through these modifications.

The legal challenges accompanying DMs are manifold. One key concern is copyright protection, particularly crucial as most applications using DMs offer only black-box APIs, limiting direct access to verify copyrights and licenses. Another challenge is the accurate detection of content generated by DMs. As these models become increasingly capable of producing highly realistic fake content, artworks, or even abusive material, potential legal risks and disputes arise. However, the effectiveness of watermarks in the context of DMs, which typically use longer, stochastic paths for sample generation and feature newly-designed multimodal structures, remains underexplored.

Stable Signature, a watermarking technique for DMs, offers a promising solution to these challenges. By embedding invisible markers in the latent space of DMs, Stable Signature enables the tracking and verification of the origin of the content. This watermarking technique is particularly robust, as it does not require any changes to the architecture of the model. Moreover, it is resistant to various transformations, including cropping, rotation, and coloring. However, the concept of "Watermark Aging" remains a significant challenge, as the watermark may degrade over time and through these transformations.

This paper aims to delve into the phenomenon of "Watermark Aging" in the context of DMs and explore the challenges and implications of watermark degradation over time and through transformations.

## Watermarking Techniques



Similar to the works of Stable Signature, this work by [] introduces a watermarking technique that embeds invisible markers in the content to track and verify its origin. However, unlike using the latent diffusion models to generate the watermark, this work uses a different approach. Specifically, for unconditional/class-conditional DMs (e.g., EDM), they embed a binary bit-string into generated images and pursue a perfect detection/recovery from generated images with a pretrained bit-string decoder. For multi-model text-to-image DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion), they embed a predefined image-text pair in the pretrained models and pursue a perfect reconstruction/generation of the predefined image conditioned on the predefined trigger (text) prompt.
